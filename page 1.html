                <span id="pyr">Great Pyrenees are bull-headed, independent, and somewhat reserved, yet attentive, fearless, and loyal to their companions. They are majestic dogs with a kind expression. Great Pyrenees are calm, composed, and serious. They are quiet indoors and content with long daily walks. They love to play in the snow, making them look even more like polar bears. They're not too keen on strangers and are great guardians.</span>

                </h3>
                <span id="goldie">Golden Retriever's have friendy expressions that say it all. They're great family dogs due to being cheerful, toy driven, trustworthy and forgiving. They are energetic dogs so it's ideal to give them two walks a day, play lots of fetch, and take them out for a run once a week. They're friendly with everyone and their bark is welcoming rather than protective. Provide lots toys so they can carry them around in their mouths. Golden Retrievers act like puppies for many years, so early obedience training is required to instill calmness and good manners. Eager to please, the mind and heart of a Golden is sweet and gentle.</span>

                </h3>
                <span id="pompom">Pomeranians are naturally curious, spunky, cocky, demanding, and animated. Vivacious and spirited, bold and brash, they think they're hot stuff. They are very energetic and aware of everything going on around. Keenly alert to approaching strangers, the Pomeranian makes a great alarm dog. Some Poms, are bossy and will attempt to chase new dogs, regardless of size. These dogs are cute, tiny, round, and fluffy. Their small size makes them easy and great dogs to dress up.</span>
